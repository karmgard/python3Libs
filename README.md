# valve.py

Simple python script for reading in a Wavefront file and displaying it on 
screen. The model is mildly manipulable. This model is a valve that I'm 
designing and will eventually be a full fledged simulation of the valve action 
under water pressure. Uses libraries ModelBuilder.py and parameteres.py from 
pythonLibs.
